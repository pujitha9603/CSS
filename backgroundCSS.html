	<pre>This Alpine peak spans the border between Switzerland and Italy.
At 4,478 metres it’s smaller than the famed Mont Blanc (4,810 metres), but its striking pyramidal shape – not to mention its spot overlooking the cosy Swiss ski town of Zermatt – makes it the poster child for the Alps.
Matterhorn was first scaled in 1865, with Brit Edward Whymper credited as the initial person to reach the summit.
His triumph was bitter sweet, though, since four climbers in Whymper’s seven-strong team plunged to their deaths during their descent.
Today, upwards of 2,000 hardy folks ascend the peak each year. 
If you’re determined to be one of them, the Hörnli ridge route is the most popular and is best attempted in summer. 
Don’t underestimate the challenge, listen to your guide and make sure you’re kitted out, crampons and all.
Otherwise, take a funicular ride from Zermatt to Rothorn for jaw-dropping views without the climb.
